# Odin-project1-recipe
This is the first Odin project.
It is a simple recipe page, that makes use of some of the basic html tags and css selectors.
It is still undergoing changes.
with time it more things will be added to it.
it is still a work in progress.

it is responsive.
I decided to use CSS grid and flex box to make it responsive in place of media query.the page is very
responsive.
This responsive recipe page is going to undergo some changes and be implemented to use an API.
An API that will bascially bring 100's of recipes.
It is going to be categorised in local and continental dishes
