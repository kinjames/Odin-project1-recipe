            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p class="note"> Pepperoni pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened <br> 
                disk of bread dough topped with some combination <br> 
                of pizza sauce, dried oregano, tomato, pepperoni, mozzarella or <br>
                other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked <br>
                quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a <br>
                wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature <br> and served hot.

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 500°F. If you are using a pizza stone, preheat it <br> in the oven for at least 20 minutes so it is nice and hot as well.</li>                    <br>
                    <li>If you are using my sauce recipe, stir together the ingredients. <br> The sauce recipe makes just enough for one large pizza. You <br> can easily double it if you are making more than one pizza.</li>                    <br>
                    <li>Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's hard to roll, let <br> it rest for 5 minutes so it can come to room temperature. For a <br> large pizza, I like to roll my dough into about a 14-inch diameter circle.</li>                    <br>
                    <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly dusted pizza peel. <br> Add sauce in a light layer all over the pizza, leaving about 1/4-inch <br>crust around the edges. Chop half of the pepperoni and sprinkle <br> it over the sauce. Top the pizza with grated cheese and the <br> rest of the pepperoni. Season with black pepper.</li>                    <br>
                    <li>If you're using a skillet, press the dough into a cast iron skillet <br> and add toppings. Place the skillet over a high heat burner for 2 <br> minutes to get it preheated and get the crust cooking right <br> away. Then transfer to a 500 ̊F oven and bake for 10 to 12 <br> minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.</li>                    <br>
                    <li>Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a cutting board. Let the <br> pizza rest for a minute and slice into pieces. Season with fresh <br> oregano (optional). Serve while warm with a side salad</li>
